## v4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- **Deprecated multiple core features.**

  - removed ability to build for service worker environment
  - `_middleware.ts` files are now treated as regular routes

- **Updated engine requirements.**

  Node.js `v18.0.0` or higher is now required.

### New Features

- **Enterprise-grade security and stability.**
  
  Our unit tests now cover all imaginable edge cases and/or features.

- **Up to 8x faster than itty-router.**
  
  darkflare no longer uses `itty-router` under the hood. We migrated to a custom router for even better performance and less overhead.

- **Custom Not Found and Error routes.**  
  
  You can now specify `_notFound.ts` and `_error.ts` routes in your `routes` directory to customize darkflare's behavior to your favor.

- **Lint your app using just a single command.**

  You can now setup eslint for your project within a matter of seconds and lint your app easily.

  ```sh-session
  darkflare lint
  ```
